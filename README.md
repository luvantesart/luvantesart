- 👀 I’m interested in learning new things, even if i'm not doing any studies about it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning (or trying) html, because web design can always be useful.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing, actually...
- 📫 How to reach me: I don't have any emails or sns to reach me, sorry:(
